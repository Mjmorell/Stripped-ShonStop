# ShonStop

ShonStop is a tool being developed for help desk environments to back up and restore user data on machines. This program is designed from the ground up to be as efficient as possible - while still focusing on guaranteeing data is backed up completely to a selected destination.

The project is still very much in the works, and is only a console application. A goal for a later date is to create a GUI for this program and push it to be open for anyone to use under an Open Source license.
